This dataset consists of 16 facebook-twitter seed user pairs and their ego networks (aka second neighborhoods, all vertices with distance at most 2 etc), 
each organized in a separate folder.


Each folder contains the next set of files:
	
* fb.txt - undirected facebook friendship graph, each line represents an edge connecting two profiles specifyied by numbers. 
Numbers are counting from 0 and 0 is the number of seed user's profile.
	
* tw.txt - the same for twitter graph (remember that we removed all non-mutual connections from the graph)
	
* right.txt - pairs of twitter and facebook profiles that belong to the same real person
	
* unary-features.csv - fuzzy string comparisons between profile attributes (see the paper for details) computed for all profile pairs. 
First two attrbutes in the file are for twitter and facebook profile numbers, the last one denotes is this particular pair a profile match (mentioned in right.txt) 
and could be either "true" or "false". "?" means that in at least one profile in the pair this attribute is missing
	
* tw-tw.txt, fb-fb.txt - binary energies computed for facebook and twitter graphs


This data is enough to reproduce the results of our paper, but we hope that it will help also in further UIR research.
